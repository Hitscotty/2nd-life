#Open Data Challenge
This hackathon aims to answer the following challenge:

How might we allow for better utilization, collection, and/or accessibility to open data such that we can improve our food system and our chances at food security?

We decided to seek a solution to:

- Improve Growing Plant Innovations: Using open data to improve how and where we grow our food.
- Empower the Crowd: Using open data to improve how we leverage the crowd’s actions and knowledge to create a better food system.
- Improve Nutrition and Health: Using open data to improve how we track, make available, and improve nutrition in our daily diets.
- Deliver Climate Smart Agriculture: Using open data to improve agriculture’s resilience in the face of a changing climate.
- Meet the Protein Frontier: Using open data to improve how we address the growing demand for protein, and the opportunity for more sustainable and alternative proteins.
